Physics-informed neural network for optical diffraction tomography

This repo includes python scripts for a 3D physics informed neural network which solves forward scattering problem (MaxwellNet3D) and using this network as a surrogate model for optimization of inverse scattering problem, namely optical diffraction tomography. The theoretical aspects of the algorithm is included in this paper:

If you use these codes, I will appriciate to cite the paper. In case of any questions, please feel free pull requests or email to contibute to this repo.
